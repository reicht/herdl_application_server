Weekend Group Project Api

I forgot to update this at all until the last minute, however the purpose of
this was to provide the server back end of the Herdl app weekend project.  It
allows for interaction from the site and postman both and includes the admin gem
for managing the database easily.  A slightly helpful api landing page with
routing information and admin access was added for ease of use.
